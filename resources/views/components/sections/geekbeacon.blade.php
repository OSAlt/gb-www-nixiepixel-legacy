                GeekBeacon is a worldwide community of geeks with a mission focused on building and growing our collective knowledge for the betterment of humanity. In a world with rapidly shifting sociopolitical, economic, and ecological climates we see the marginalized being pushed further to the margins. GeekBeacon strives to make tech and gaming more accessible with projects and research to find new adaptations and innovations. From coding tutorials to community game nights, from chat hangouts to mental health support groups, we draw geeks from all nerddoms together. Sharing information and experiences, guiding one another in creating a collective that strengthens and empowers with an ultimate goal of doing social good.
